# aMazeingRobots
 In the course Object oriented programing we are set to create a guiding system for theoretical robots. Involving file-handling and reading. The assignment is to create three main classes “Maze” “Position” and “Robot”. From which we are to create the guiding system. The maze should be created from an input file with a specified structure. The Robot-class is an abstract class used to create different types of robots. To specify how each individual robots movement differs from others they all have their own “move” method. To navigate through the maze the use of the Position class is applied. Which is used to specify the x and y coordinates of a specified Position in the maze, and also check which positions are to the north, south, east and west. We are to implement at least two robots, one that follows the right hand rule and the other that is a memory robot that uses the knowledge of where it has been to do a depth first search of the maze.
